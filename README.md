# Constrained Subgroup Discovery -- LaTeX Sources

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for two papers and related materials on constrained subgroup discovery.
You can also find copies of the corresponding published versions as PDFs in the folder `final_versions/`.

> Bach, Jakob (2024): "Using Constraints to Discover Sparse and Alternative Subgroup Descriptions"

> Bach, Jakob (2025): "Subgroup Discovery with Small and Alternative Feature Sets"

is published in the [proceedings of the conference SIGMOD 2025](https://doi.org/10.1145/3725358).
You can find the paper's (camera-ready) source code in the folder `paper_sigmod/`, the corresponding presentation in the folder `presentation_sigmod/`, and the poster in the folder `poster_sigmod/`.
However, you cannot compile these documents without some externals files (classes, styles, logos), which we do not provide here due to copyright reasons.
